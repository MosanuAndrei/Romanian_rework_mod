# Awaken thee, Romanian!
Awaken thee, Romanian is a rework mod for the Romanian Principalities, offering a more flavoured filled way of forming Romania as opposed to vanilla Vic3 where you have to go to war with literally every single Great Power that surrounds you to even form it.


Features:

• New journal entries and events for Wallachia, Moldavia and Romania.

• Two ways to form Romania: Following the historical path as Wallachia by achieving the Little Union, drafting the first Constitution of Romania and fighting for your independence or the alt-history path as Moldavia by modernizing your army, industry and state, joining the Russian Empire in exchange of Bessarabia and conquering the rest of Romania.

• The ability for the AI to form the Little Union and Romania at specific historical dates: 1859 and 1866 as well as gaining claims on all the Romanian lands

• The law systems of both principalities have been reworked to better reflect the state of things in 1836

• Fixed The Wallachian and Moldovian flags as well as adding new flags such as the Brotherhood and Justice revolutionary flag, the Little Union flag and a war flag for Wallachia

• Dynamic map color and name for Wallachia once the Little Union is achieved

• The color of Romania was changed from blue to yellow like it used to be in Victoria II and Hearts of Iron IV



Potential issues:

• If the Ottoman Empire fails to modernize it will release all its subjects, if that happens and you already formed the PU with Moldavia it will leave your PU without any notice or diplomatic play, you have a decision to fix the bug found in the Decisions tab.

It is strongly recommended to install an Austria-Hungary color mod since both countries will share more or less the same color.
