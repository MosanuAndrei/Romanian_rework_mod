# Awaken thee, Romanian!
Awaken thee, Romanian is a rework mod for Wallachia/Romania, it adds a more historical and flavour filled way to form Romania as opposed to vanilla Vic3 where you have to go to war with literally every single Great Power that surrounds you to even form it.

Features:
    -New journal entries and events that will guide you through out the 19th century, such as: drafting the first Constitution of Romania, achieving the Little     -Union, fight for your independence and embark on the arduous task of forming Greater Romania!
    -The ability for the AI to form the Little Union and Romania at specific historical dates: 1859 and 1866
    -The law systems of both principalities have been reworked to better reflect the state of things in 1836
    -Fixed The Wallachian and Moldovian flags as well as adding new flags such as the Brotherhood and Justice revolutionary flag, the Little Union flag and a        war flag for Wallachia
    -Dynamic map color and name for Wallachia once the Little Union is achieved
    -The color of Romania was changed from blue to yellow like it used to be in Victoria II and Hearts of Iron IV

Installation guide:

Step 1: Place the "Awaken thee, Romanian!" folder in "C:\Users\username\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Victoria 3\mod"

Step 2: To enable the mod you need first to create a Playset in the Paradox Launcher, it's under Resume/Play buttons.

Potential issues:

    For unknown reasons the Ottoman Empire might grant independence to both principalities, if that happens and you already formed the PU with Moldavia it will leave your PU without any notice or diplomatic play, if that happens you have a decision to fix the bug found in the Decisions tab.

Special thanks to Mr.StelarCF contribution! He added the features with the * fixed some of the localisations and created the thumbnail.
