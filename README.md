# Awaken thee, Romanian!
Awaken thee, Romanian is a rework mod of Wallachia/Romania, it adds a more historical and flavour filled way to form Romania as opposed to vanilla Vic3 where you have to go to war with literally all the Great Powers that surround you to even form it. It also adds a bunch of journal entries, events and the ability for the AI to form the Little Union and Romania at specific historical dates!

-To form Romania you will need to draft the First Constitution which will require you to reform the Wallachian state, guarantee the basic human rights to your people and unite the thrones of Wallachia and Moldavia into one personal union, the Little Union as its often called.

-Once Romania is formed you will need to secure your independence from the Ottoman Empire as well as liberating the province of Dobruja and gaining access to the Black Sea.

-With your independence secured you can embark on the arduous task of forming Greater Romania, which will require you to fight both the Austrians for Transylvania and the Russians for Bessarabia with the ambitious goal of uniting all romanians under one state.

-The color of Austria was changed from yellow to brownish-red like it used to be in Victoria II

-The color of Romania was changed from blue to yellow like it used to be in Victoria II and Hearts of Iron IV

Potential issues:

-For unknown reasons Moldavia might decide to leave your personal union without any notice or diplomatic play, if that happens you have a decision to fix the bug.
